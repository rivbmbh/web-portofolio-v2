            I someone who doesn't consider themselves exceptional but always
            strives to improve and develop their skills, aspiring to become a
            person with clear goals in life. I also enjoy playing games, but
            it's mostly to pass the time, not much more. Additionally, you like
            to go for rides on your motorcycle.
