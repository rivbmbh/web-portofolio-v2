          <p className="text-base text-center sm:px-4">
            I am an Information Systems graduate who discovered a passion for
            programming starting in my fifth semester. Over the past three
            years, I have been learning independently, exploring various tech
            stacks, and joining trainings to strengthen my skills. Beyond
            coding, I also have an interest in graphic design and digital
            mapping, which allow me to combine creativity with technical
            expertise.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base text-center sm:px-4">
            As part of this learning journey, below I’ve included several
            certificates from trainings and programs I’ve completed.
